Rublon protects your account from sign ins from unknown devices, even if your password gets stolen.

== Description ==

Rublon protects your account from sign ins from unknown devices, even if your password gets stolen. It's totally seamless way of securing your online accounts and the easiest two-factor authentication solution in the world.

Your online accounts can be accessed from any device in the world, often without your knowledge. Rublon protects your personal data, as well as business and financial operations, by restricting access from unknown devices.

Use Rublon to manage and define the devices you trust, such as your laptop, tablet and mobile phone. Rublon secured accounts will only be accessible from your Trusted Devices. The Rublon mobile app allows you to add or remove Trusted Devices at any time, anywhere you are.

Rublon is an additional security layer that verifies whether you are signing in from a Trusted Device. It works on top of any existing authentication process. This means that you still have to type your username and password or use a social login button to sign in, but it must be done on a Trusted Device in order to access your account. And if you want to sign in using a new device, simply confirm your identity using Rublon, and then add it to your Trusted Devices.

You can protect your data by securing your account with Rublon on every web service that uses our security system. If your web service does not, please contact your system administrator and ask him to integrate Rublon.
