Stronger protection for online accounts: Rublon protects your users' accounts from hackers, even if they steal their passwords.

== Description ==

Rublon provides stronger protection for all users of your WordPress website through automatic two-factor authentication. It protects their accounts from sign-ins from unknown devices, even if their passwords get stolen. Find out more at http://www.rublon.com.

Rublon for WordPress requires the Rublon mobile app, which lets you define your Trusted Devices. Available for Android, BlackBerry, iPhone and Windows Phone: www.rublon.com/get

+++

Your online accounts can be accessed from any device in the world, often without your knowledge. Rublon protects your personal data, as well as business and financial operations, by restricting access from unknown devices.

Use Rublon to manage and define the devices you trust, such as your laptop, tablet and mobile phone. Rublon protected accounts will only be accessible from your Trusted Devices. The Rublon mobile app allows you to add or remove Trusted Devices at any time, anywhere you are.

Rublon is an additional security layer that verifies whether you are signing in from a Trusted Device. It works on top of any existing authentication process. This means that you still have to type your username and password or use a social login button to sign in, but it must be done on a Trusted Device in order to access your account. And if you want to sign in using a new device, simply confirm your identity using Rublon, and then add it to your Trusted Devices.

You can protect your data by protecting your account with Rublon on every web service that uses our security system. If your web service does not, please contact your system administrator and ask him to integrate Rublon.

= Do I have to use my smartphone at each sign in? =

No! Your smartphone is only needed when you sign in from a new device. It is used to prove your identity and allows you to add such a device to your trusted devices. Any sign in from a trusted device works the same way as before: simply enter your login credentials. Rublon works as an invisible security layer during the sign in process.
